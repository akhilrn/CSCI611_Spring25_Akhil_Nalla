Project Title

Implementation of Image Filtering Techniques and Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
________________________________________
Description
This project includes two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key aspects of image processing and machine learning using Python.
1. Image Filtering Notebook (image_filtering_completed.ipynb)
•	Implements various image filtering techniques using libraries such as OpenCV and PIL.
•	Covers techniques such as grayscale conversion, blurring, edge detection, thresholding, and applying custom filters.
•	Demonstrates how to enhance and manipulate images through Python code.
2. CNN Model Notebook (Completed_build_cnn.ipynb)
•	Builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks.
•	Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to construct, train, and evaluate the CNN model.
•	Uses the CIFAR-10 dataset for classification and provides insights through accuracy and loss metrics.
